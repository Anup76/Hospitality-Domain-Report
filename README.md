"Delighted to share my captivating project on ‘Revenue Insights in the Hospitality Industry’!"

Through this journey, I have had the opportunity to explore the unique obstacles faced by the hospitality industry and apply my expertise in data analytics to tackle practical issues.

## Project Overview
Atliq Grands has seen a decline in its market share and revenue due to competitive pressures and management decisions. This project is centered around revitalizing the business by utilizing hospitality analytics to make well-informed decisions.

## Project Goal
This project aims to boost Atliq Grands' market share and revenue within the luxury business hotel sector. The company aims to surpass competitors and enhance management decision-making by applying data-driven strategies and business intelligence

## Data Structure and Data Modeling
I gathered the dataset used from Codebasics’ website.

The datasets contain Two types of tables -->

Dimension table: Static data like customer and product details.

Fact table: Transaction data.

1. dim_date
2. dim_hotels
3. dim_rooms
4. fact_aggregated_bookings
5. fact_bookings

Leveraging Power BI, I have created a dynamic dashboard that offers valuable insights into essential elements of the Hospitality Domain:

Key Metrics:-
1. 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗣𝗔𝗥 (Revenue Per Available Room): A critical metric for understanding revenue generation.
2. 𝗔𝗗𝗥 (Average Daily Rate): Analyzing the average rate paid for rooms sold.
3. 𝗗𝗕𝗥𝗡 (Daily Booked Room Nights): Tracking daily room bookings.
4. 𝗗𝗦𝗥𝗡 (Daily Sellable Room Nights): The number of rooms available for sale each day.
5. 𝗗𝗨𝗥𝗡 (Daily Utilized Room Nights): Insights into the number of rooms utilized by customers daily.


Exploring the intricacies and nuances of the hospitality domain has provided an exceptional opportunity for learning. Every industry presents its own distinct data landscape that requires careful navigation.
