"Delighted to share my captivating project on ‘Revenue Insights in the Hospitality Industry’!"

Through this journey, I have had the opportunity to explore the unique obstacles faced by the hospitality industry and apply my expertise in data analytics to tackle practical issues.

This project aimed to offer data-driven perspectives to the Revenue team within the hospitality sector. It is an exhilarating challenge to utilize data analytics in order to address real-world obstacles and make well-informed decisions.

Leveraging Power BI, I have created a dynamic dashboard that offers valuable insights into essential elements of the Hospitality Domain:
1. 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗣𝗔𝗥 (Revenue Per Available Room): A critical metric for understanding revenue generation.
2. 𝗔𝗗𝗥 (Average Daily Rate): Analyzing the average rate paid for rooms sold.
3. 𝗗𝗕𝗥𝗡 (Daily Booked Room Nights): Tracking daily room bookings.
4. 𝗗𝗦𝗥𝗡 (Daily Sellable Room Nights): The number of rooms available for sale each day.
5. 𝗗𝗨𝗥𝗡 (Daily Utilized Room Nights): Insights into the number of rooms utilized by customers daily.


Exploring the intricacies and nuances of the hospitality domain has provided an exceptional opportunity for learning. Every industry presents its own distinct data landscape that requires careful navigation.
